Sensitivity: 
- Precentage of true defaulters that are correctly identified; 
or among the people who will default, how many of them are predicted to default(portion)

Specificity: 
- Percentage of non-defaulters that are correctly identified
or among the people who will not default, how may of thm are predicted not to default(portion)

True Positive rate:
- same as Sensitivity

False Positive rate:
- 1- Specificity
- Among the folks who will not default, the portion classifed as default
- Positive stands for default
- False stands for mis-classification
- Mistakely classify someone to default
- Type I error(similar to testing, refject H0 when it is corrrect)
- 冤枉好人, 没病说有病


ROC curve
- Plot the True positive rate against False positive, for all possible threshold
- Good to compare difference classifers
- Take into account all possible threshold
- Area Under Curve(AUC), larger the better
