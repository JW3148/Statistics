why linear algebra
  to represent higher dimension. e.g. lines in 3D or higher can be represented be parameterized equation
  
vector
  (3,2) means 3 steps right and 2 steps up.
  direction+lenth
  positioned vector - used to define lines(parameterized equations)
  
unit vector
  vector has length of 1
