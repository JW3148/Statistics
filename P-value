vary nice article to break down p value

'What a nerdy debate about p-values shows about science — and how to fix it'

Here is just a summary of it

How ridiculous would it be to believe the null hypothesis is the true answer, given the results we’re seeing?

Null hypothesis testing follows a similar logic: If there are huge and consistent weight differences between the chocolate eaters and chocolate abstainers, 
the null hypothesis — that there are no weight differences — starts to look silly. And you can reject it.

If the null hypothesis is right, the result we're seeing is STATISTICALY unlikely, or RARE

That is, it’s how rare the results would be if nothing in your experiment worked, and the difference in weight was due to random chance alone.

The p-value quantifies this rareness. It tells you how often you’d see the numerical results of an experiment — or even more extreme results — 
if the null hypothesis is true and there’s no difference between the groups.

Ideally, a p of .05 means if you ran the experiment 100 times — again, assuming the null hypothesis is true 
— you’d see these same numbers (or more extreme results) five times.

Type I Error: Reject null hypo when it is correct. false positive. Mistakenly reject null hypo when you shouldn't
